## 💰 Cost Breakdown - The Reality

| Service | Setup Cost | Monthly Cost | Yearly Cost |
|---------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **GitHub** | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Vercel Hosting** | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **SSL Certificate** | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Bandwidth (100GB)** | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Automatic Deployments** | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Support** | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **TOTAL** | **$0** | **$0** | **$0** |

**Wix Status:**
- Already paid: ~$200-400/year
- This is a "sunk cost" (already spent, can't recover)
- Using Vercel doesn't cost you MORE money
- Trying to "use" Wix will cost you MORE (60-80 hours rebuilding)

**Smart Decision:** Use free Vercel, accept Wix as sunk cost

---

## ⏱️ Time Investment

| Phase | Active Time | Waiting Time |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Reading guides** | 30 min | 0 min |
| **GitHub setup** | 5 min | 0 min |
| **Vercel deployment** | 10 min | 2-3 min |
| **DNS configuration** | 10 min | 1-24 hours |
| **Testing** | 5 min | 0 min |
| **TOTAL ACTIVE** | **60 min** | **1-24 hours** |

**Note:** The 1-24 hour wait is DNS propagation - you don't need to do anything during this time.
